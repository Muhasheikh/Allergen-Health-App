              <h3>Litreature Survey</h3>
              <p class="mt-4 mb-5">
                The diagnosis of food allergies was the subject of comparative
                research conducted in 2013 by Philippe Bégin and Kari C. Nadeau.
                Research has shown that it may be difficult to interpret allergy
                test findings and that the patient history is often incorrect
                when screening for and treating food allergies [7].<span
                  id="dots"
                  >...</span
                ><span id="more">
                  Consequently, relying exclusively on medical history to
                  monitor dietary allergens that cause allergies will not be
                  adequate. Additionally, studies have shown that when an
                  allergen enters the stomach, in addition to instantly causing
                  local symptoms (skin responses) upon contact with the meal, it
                  may also result in excruciating stomach pain and prolonged
                  vomiting. Therefore, it is conceivable to infer that methods
                  for recording symptoms may be used to identify potential food
                  allergies. To determine the links between food consumption,
                  mental discomfort, and digestive issues, Egbert Clevers, Hans
                  Törnblom, Magnus Simrén, Jan Tack, and Lukas Van Oudenhove
                  performed another study in 2016.<br> The major goal of this study
                  was to demonstrate how patterns in food consumption and
                  symptomatology may be utilized to anticipate digestive issues.
                  A variety of challenges relating to the forecasting and
                  assessment of the input data utilizing tools like machine
                  learning have also been addressed in the study. It has been
                  shown that there is a link between food consumption and
                  symptoms, which may be examined using deep learning and
                  machine learning. Find Me Gluten Free an application used to
                  suggest the Gluten Free Restaurants. Finding restaurants that
                  can accommodate your needs can be made easier with Find Me
                  Gluten Free if you have celiac disease, wheat sensitivity, or
                  you simply need to avoid gluten [7]. This application only
                  focuses on the Gluten allergen. Wheat (wheatberries, durum,
                  emmer, semolina, spelt, farina, farro, graham, KAMUT® Khorasan
                  wheat, and einkorn), rye, barley, and triticale, a hybrid
                  between wheat and rye, all contain the protein known as
                  gluten. By serving as a glue to hold food components together,
                  gluten aids in the preservation of food form. Even items you
                  would not expect to contain gluten can be discovered in
                  copious quantities [14]. Although Celiac Disease exists, there
                  is no such thing as a gluten allergy. Undiagnosed or untreated
                  celiac disease is a digestive issue that might become
                  dangerous. A rash, extreme weight loss or failure to
                  appropriately gain weight, severe diarrhea after consuming
                  gluten-containing foods, and stomach discomfort are all signs
                  of celiac disease. You could only notice poor weight gain and
                  no discomfort or other symptoms in young children. The only
                  person qualified to diagnose celiac disease is a
                  gastroenterologist with board certification. Because avoiding
                  gluten is the main form of therapy, it must also be done when
                  the patient consumes gluten-containing foods. There are
                  presently no diagnostic tests for an appropriate diagnosis of
                  a gluten intolerance, which is not an allergy. Although only a
                  small percentage of persons with gluten intolerance have
                  celiac disease, those who exhibit particular symptoms may need
                  to be tested. Gluten intolerance is not a sign that you should
                  get tested for allergies and is not a disease for which an
                  allergist can treat. Unfortunately, many people who claim to
                  be "sensitive" to gluten restrict their diet without first
                  seeing a doctor. If there is a worry about celiac disease,
                  people with gluten sensitivity should visit their health care
                  physician or be referred to a gastroenterologist. Open Food
                  Facts is an easy-to-use barcode scanner app that is designed
                  to help you decipher complex food labels. Although the app was
                  not created with allergens specifically in mind, it does have
                  a couple of allergen-specific features that help to make
                  grocery shopping that little bit easier. This app does not
                  focus on recipe prediction and not even considering any food
                  restriction among the people. Diabetes, one of the most
                  prevalent non-communicable illnesses in modern society, was
                  the focus of Pivithuru and Hewa Bajjagamage Beenuka's study.
                  Therefore, the goal of this study was to use technology to
                  improve the lives of diabetes patients by providing customized
                  meal plans that are updated often. A mobile Android
                  application will be used as the proposed solution to provide
                  different meal options. The recommended method enables users
                  to see their diabetes status, that is, whether they have
                  diabetes or not, in addition to offering meal planning. Based
                  on patient blood report records and BMI values, a manually
                  constructed dataset was used for the method of creating meal
                  plans, and secondary data were used for the purpose of
                  predicting diabetes status. Techniques from machine learning
                  were used in this performance. Three classification models
                  were trained independently to determine the diabetes status
                  and offer meal plans for the user. With respect to the three
                  models developed, Random Forest had the highest accuracy rates
                  for meal plan suggestions and the challenge of predicting
                  diabetes status, both at 72.9%. Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study
                  (TLGS) is being conducted by Fereidoun Azizi and
                  collaborators. A long-term, comprehensive community-based
                  initiative called TLGS promotes a healthy lifestyle and lowers
                  risk factors for the emergence of non-communicable diseases
                  (NCDs) in order to avoid them (NCD). The 1999 research will
                  take at least another 20 years to complete. A preliminary
                  survey of 15005 adults over the age of 3 was conducted in
                  order to collect baseline data. Participants were chosen from
                  cohorts of three medical health facilities. A "computer-aided
                  system" is anything that quickly records acquired data on a
                  computer using database software. In order to reduce or
                  prevent the development of NCD risk factors and outcomes in
                  the TLGS group, this study will assess the feasibility and
                  efficacy of lifestyle modification. The main objective of the
                  study is to evaluate the viability and efficacy of therapy for
                  lifestyle modification in avoiding or delaying the emergence
                  of NCD risk factors and outcomes in a population undergoing
                  dietary change. but the majority have suffered alteration in
