            <h3>Litreature Survey</h3>
            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">
              The diagnosis of food allergies was the subject of comparative
              research conducted in 2013 by Philippe Bégin and Kari C. Nadeau.
              Research has shown that it may be difficult to interpret allergy
              test findings and that the patient history is often incorrect
              when screening for and treating food allergies [7].<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">
                Consequently, relying exclusively on medical history to
                monitor dietary allergens that cause allergies will not be
                adequate. Additionally, studies have shown that when an
                allergen enters the stomach, in addition to instantly causing
                local symptoms (skin responses) upon contact with the meal, it
                may also result in excruciating stomach pain and prolonged
                vomiting. Therefore, it is conceivable to infer that methods
                for recording symptoms may be used to identify potential food
                allergies. To determine the links between food consumption,
                mental discomfort, and digestive issues, Egbert Clevers, Hans
                Törnblom, Magnus Simrén, Jan Tack, and Lukas Van Oudenhove
                performed another study in 2016.<br /><br />
                The major goal of this study was to demonstrate how patterns
                in food consumption and symptomatology may be utilized to
                anticipate digestive issues. A variety of challenges relating
                to the forecasting and assessment of the input data utilizing
                tools like machine learning have also been addressed in the
                study. It has been shown that there is a link between food
                consumption and symptoms, which may be examined using deep
                learning and machine learning. Find Me Gluten Free an
                application used to suggest the Gluten Free Restaurants.
                Finding restaurants that can accommodate your needs can be
                made easier with Find Me Gluten Free if you have celiac
                disease, wheat sensitivity, or you simply need to avoid gluten
                [7].<br /><br />
                This application only focuses on the Gluten allergen. Wheat
                (wheatberries, durum, emmer, semolina, spelt, farina, farro,
                graham, KAMUT® Khorasan wheat, and einkorn), rye, barley, and
                triticale, a hybrid between wheat and rye, all contain the
                protein known as gluten. By serving as a glue to hold food
                components together, gluten aids in the preservation of food
                form. Even items you would not expect to contain gluten can be
                discovered in copious quantities [14]. Although Celiac Disease
                exists, there is no such thing as a gluten allergy.
                Undiagnosed or untreated celiac disease is a digestive issue
                that might become dangerous. A rash, extreme weight loss or
                failure to appropriately gain weight, severe diarrhea after
                consuming gluten-containing foods, and stomach discomfort are
                all signs of celiac disease. You could only notice poor weight
                gain and no discomfort or other symptoms in young children.<br /><br />
                The only person qualified to diagnose celiac disease is a
                gastroenterologist with board certification. Because avoiding
                gluten is the main form of therapy, it must also be done when
                the patient consumes gluten-containing foods. There are
                presently no diagnostic tests for an appropriate diagnosis of
                a gluten intolerance, which is not an allergy. Although only a
                small percentage of persons with gluten intolerance have
                celiac disease, those who exhibit particular symptoms may need
                to be tested. Gluten intolerance is not a sign that you should
                get tested for allergies and is not a disease for which an
                allergist can treat. Unfortunately, many people who claim to
                be "sensitive" to gluten restrict their diet without first
                seeing a doctor. If there is a worry about celiac disease,
                people with gluten sensitivity should visit their health care
                physician or be referred to a gastroenterologist. Open Food
                Facts is an easy-to-use barcode scanner app that is designed
                to help you decipher complex food labels. Although the app was
                not created with allergens specifically in mind, it does have
                a couple of allergen-specific features that help to make
                grocery shopping that little bit easier. This app does not
                focus on recipe prediction and not even considering any food
                restriction among the people.<br /><br />
                Diabetes, one of the most prevalent non-communicable illnesses
                in modern society, was the focus of Pivithuru and Hewa
                Bajjagamage Beenuka's study. Therefore, the goal of this study
                was to use technology to improve the lives of diabetes
                patients by providing customized meal plans that are updated
                often. A mobile Android application will be used as the
                proposed solution to provide different meal options. The
                recommended method enables users to see their diabetes status,
                that is, whether they have diabetes or not, in addition to
                offering meal planning. Based on patient blood report records
                and BMI values, a manually constructed dataset was used for
                the method of creating meal plans, and secondary data were
                used for the purpose of predicting diabetes status. Techniques
                from machine learning were used in this performance. Three
                classification models were trained independently to determine
                the diabetes status and offer meal plans for the user.<br /><br />
                With respect to the three models developed, Random Forest had
                the highest accuracy rates for meal plan suggestions and the
                challenge of predicting diabetes status, both at 72.9%. Tehran
                Lipid and Glucose Study (TLGS) is being conducted by Fereidoun
                Azizi and collaborators. A long-term, comprehensive
                community-based initiative called TLGS promotes a healthy
                lifestyle and lowers risk factors for the emergence of
                non-communicable diseases (NCDs) in order to avoid them (NCD).
                The 1999 research will take at least another 20 years to
                complete. A preliminary survey of 15005 adults over the age of
                3 was conducted in order to collect baseline data.
                Participants were chosen from cohorts of three medical health
                facilities. A "computer-aided system" is anything that quickly
                records acquired data on a computer using database software.
                In order to reduce or prevent the development of NCD risk
                factors and outcomes in the TLGS group, this study will assess
                the feasibility and efficacy of lifestyle modification. The
                main objective of the study is to evaluate the viability and
                efficacy of therapy for lifestyle modification in avoiding or
                delaying the emergence of NCD risk factors and outcomes in a
                population undergoing dietary change. but the majority have

              While considering the researchers most researchers aims to
              solving a real-life problem through doing a research. Likewise,
              to solve Food allergy related symptom and vice versa there were
              many researches relating to food allergy systems for prediction
              of the user’s allergy and allergens that caused the allergy by
              analyzing the symptoms and food items entered by the user. When
              compared to the past existing applications lots are developed to
              predict symptoms by using list of entered foods<span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1">
                As well as there are many systems to take count of food
                alleriges by adding or writing manually. ‘AllergyEats’ is a
                system that If you’ve got food allergies, you can only eat so
                many things at many popular restaurants. This app helps walk
                you through the most allergy-friendly restaurants for a
                variety of food allergies, breaks down menu items that are
                safe to eat, and even organizes restaurant listings by major
                cities. In this system Food-allergic diners can search for
                allergy-friendly restaurants based on desired location and
                dietary restrictions.<br /><br />
                Ratings and comments provided by food-allergic peers help
                others make more informed dining decisions. The ratings
                process is quick and simple and focuses only on a restaurant’s
                allergy-friendliness – not its cuisine, price, or ambiance.
                Another system is ‘mySymptoms Food Diary & Symptom Tracker’.
                This app helps you track your symptoms, allergy episodes,
                bowel movements, and any other major events. It can help you
                better understand the patterns of your allergies and what
                diet, lifestyle, or exercise routines may trigger your worst
                symptoms and how to manage them in the meantime it helps to
                track your diet and symptoms along with medications, sleep,
                stress, exercise, and any environmental factors and view
                trends in frequency and intensity for both your diet and
                symptoms.<br /><br />
                ‘Food Intolerances’ is also another app, understanding your
                food allergies can be overwhelming when they involve so many
                variables of nutrients, minerals, and vitamins. The Food
                Intolerances app helps you make sense of the science behind
                food allergies for a number of different types, including
                gluten-free and peanut allergies. It also helps you dive deep
                into the details around histamine intolerances, carbohydrate
                malabsorption, and many other interactions that result in food
                allergies. Then, you can build your diet around your knowledge
                to help prevent uncomfortable or life-threatening allergy
                symptoms. <br /><br />There are more systems to keep track of
                food allergy symptoms and your diet plan. In existing systems
                many researchers have carried out as discussed in the apps
                above. The problem is it’s limited only for certain criteria
                of foods, cuisines and restaurants. Generally, there is no
                method to keep track of allergies, foods that are not well
                known. As well as in most systems by default have list of
                terms defined. Users must select what they experience. From
                that it gives prediction. Already the terminologies are added
                to the database. As Sri Lankans most people consumed
                traditional foods so it’s important to know the ingredients
                involved of that type of foods. In existing systems such as
                Food Intolerances, mySymptoms Food Diary & Symptom Tracker and
                AllergyEats all those systems has predefined set of terms.
                And, in database it has large number of records.<br /><br />
                In AllergyEats it find’s and rate restaurants in any city
                based on the restaurant’s ability to accommodate diners with
                food allergies, including dairy, peanut, tree nut, fish,
                seafood, soy, sesame, wheat and egg allergies, as well as
                those with Celiac Disease, gluten sensitivity, and other
                dietary conditions. Most systems just have limited
                functionality either it deals with only food allergy symptoms
                tracking, measure Calories intake, suggests meals with
                Allergen free foods or Predict Non communicable diseases. So
                that from our system we are able to bring all functionalities
                into a single app.<br /><br />
                Our app provides the following functionalities food allergy
                and food restriction prevention, allergy free recipe
                prediction, prediction of the user’s allergy and allergens
                that caused the allergy by analyzing the symptoms and food
                items entered by the user, predicting the time it takes to
                become obese and the risk of developing non-communicable
                diseases based on the user's daily meal plan and recommending
                healthy tips to avoid those diseases and keep tracking of food
                intake, nutrients and calories in the food diary and
                recommending meal plan.

              A food allergy is an abnormal immune response to food. [8]. The
              symptoms of the allergic reaction may range from mild to severe.
              <span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">
                They may include itchiness, swelling of the tongue, vomiting,
                diarrhea, hives, trouble breathing, or low blood pressure. The
                patient/user should enter the food items he consumed within 24
                hours and symptoms into the application. Food allergy symptoms
                usually develop within a few minutes to two hours after eating
                the offending food. [9]. The majority of people have no idea
                whether they have allergies to what they eat and what side
                effects they would get due to consuming a portion of food.
                Also, there have been several problems identifying the
                ingredients of products that are allergic for several
                people.<br /><br />
                Some food codes do not clearly describe the ingredients.
                Finding the ingredients printed in small letters and finding
                it is challenging and time-consuming. Also, consumers should
                be able to test their foods for allergies and find proper
                spots to find their allergy-free food whenever and wherever
                they are. Traditional laboratory-based detection technologies
                are often unsuitable for consumers due to the requirement of a
                scientific background. As a result, developing a convenient
                and straightforward solution linked to human lives as
                detectors to improve user accessibility is critical.

              The system shall predict the food item/allergens cause the
              allergy by analyzing the entered data for three weeks. It
              is likely to be affected if frequently consumed food items
              are within the 'big eight'; the eight food groups
              responsible for 90% of food allergy reactions. Once the
              food item is predicted, it can be eliminated. This
              elimination of Allergens involves removing a particular
              food from the user's diet for two weeks. That way, the
              users know that the food eliminated was causing the
              allergies and can be refrained. The app would aid in

                In our method, a food context and allergy-free substitute
                ingredients are extracted from known food recipes, and
                they are attached to unknown food recipes based on the
                similarity between recipes. In order to calculate the
                recipe similarity, we extract the following recipe
                metadata from each recipe. The information of ingredients
                and equipment is extracted and used as keywords in a
                recipe. The context metadata is a set of keywords for
                capturing the food context in the targeted dish,<br /><br />
                such as the function of an allergic component, the
                texture, and the color, which are not explicitly defined
                in the recipe. As a result, in this study, a cooking
                expert extracts context metadata from a small portion of
                the recipe. To find allergy-free ingredients for a
                specific recipe, our method first computes the similarity
                between the targeted recipe and the user’s Input allergen
                and process using NLP. Then, using our method, we extract
                allergy-free ingredients with scores, which are then
                associated with recipes in the top rank. Furthermore, each
                allergy-free ingredient's total score is computed, and the
                allergy-free ingredients with the highest total scores are
                recommended for the targeted food.

                The purpose of this component is to avoid the user's food

                recipe is categorized into specific user’s food
                preferences. The user's preferred food restriction is
                avoided, and that should be altered with the user’s
                permitted ingredient according to the Figure 10 religious
                diary restriction diagram.

              <li>Measure Calorie Counts Through an Image</li>
              <br />
              <span>
                The proposed system is intended to calculate calories
                using an image. The calorie counter model will count the
                calories of the meal plan through an image and confirm the
                user's total calorie intake after the meal plan is
                provided according to the schedule (according to the
                schedule provider step - C). Various image processing and
                machine learning techniques are used to design the Calorie
                measurement system. It first discovered an image data set
                and a calorie data set. It took over 1000 food images of
                various types of Sri Lankan foods and images from kaggle.
                And the calorie dataset was obtained from a doctor. A
                doctor contributes to the creation of that dataset by
                providing advice and information. in this component it
                includes 3 steps 1) Camera function development, 2) Object
                detection and segmentation,3) Send notifications. In the
                following it explains these steps in more detail.

              <li>Object Detection and Segmentation</li>
              <br />
              <span>
                This component is very important in this system. And if
                the researcher can obtain an accurate result from this
                section, it will aid in the development of this system. It
                develops two models for object detection and food
                segmentation in this segment. Detecting instances of
                visual objects of a specific class (such as humans,
                animals, or cars) in digital images is a significant
                computer vision task. In this step, it detects the plate
                first using an object detection model known as MobileNet.
                It detects plate objects in order to identify the foods
                individually. When the user captured the image according
                to the constraints, it identified the plate size and
                cropped the image. After cropping the image, the
                segmentation method is used to identify foods that are
                similar.<br /><br />
                It trained a model to detect objects using pixel counts in
                this case. MaskRCNN is used during the segmentation
                process. MaskRCNN is a simple, adaptable, and widely used
                framework for object instance detection [16]. It then
                calculates the pixel count of that food object's area.
                Calorie counts per pixel were saved in the database, and
                after obtaining the pixel count of foods via MaskRCNN, it
                manipulates the pixel counts stored in the database, which
                is calories per pixel count. Finally, this calculation
                yields the number of calories consumed by the user.
                Calorie Count = Per pixel calorie count * pixel count of
                food area.

              <li>Send Notification</li>
              <br />
              <span>
                Finally, when the calculations and measurements are
                completed, it checks and sends a notification to the user
                that the total calorie count has been completed. Following
                that, if the assigned calorie counts are correctly taken,
                a notification is sent to the user stating that the user
                takes this total calorie count. This is accomplished by
                sending notifications via the Android application.

                much time it takes to become obese according to his eating
                pattern. Form this feature user can get an idea about his
                meals. Inhere the system consider his BMI value and his

            <h3>Methodology </h3>
            <p class="mt-4 mb-5">
              Most people have no idea whether they have allergies to what they eat and what side effects they would get
              due to consuming a portion of food. With the development of technology, there is vital room for innovative
              software pieces in human lives to predict the allergens that caused the allergy once diagnosed with the
              allergic reaction.
              <span id="dots4">...</span><span id="more4">
                On the other hand, the number of deaths due to non-communicable diseases in the world is increasing day
                by day. Many people are susceptible to non-communicable diseases due to a lack of awareness about the
                spread of non-communicable diseases in humans. The main causes of non-communicable diseases are inactive
                lifestyles and poor eating habits.Traditional laboratory-based detection technologies and historical
                records tracking are often unreliable for consumers due to the requirement of a scientific background.
                As a result, developing a convenient and straightforward solution linked to human lives as detectors to
                improve user accessibility is critical.<br><br>

                To test the hypothesis that how many of the majority population are aware of food allergies and related
                facts, an online survey was distributed to a sample of hundred people. Respondents were asked around
                twelve questions to cover the domain. Given its observations, the concept of developing a mobile
                application to predict food allergies and non-communicable diseases and get a self-diagnosis shall be
                paramount in food allergy prevention and control.<br><br>

                For instance, as shown in Figure 1, twenty-four (24%) people reported having food allergies, fifty
                people (50%) do not have food allergies, and 26% of the total population is unaware of their conditions.
                On the other hand, as shown in figure 2 and figure 3, 60% of the population with FA know about the
                possible symptoms of food allergies, and 67% of people are clueless about the primary precautions to be
                taken before seeking professional advice from a physician, which is where our proposed mobile
                application comes into effect.
